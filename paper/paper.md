Abstract
Computer vision is designed to imitate human vision. In order to imitate human vision, enabling computer to see is not enough, computer needs to be able to analyze what it sees. What computer sees is essentially frames of images which means nothing to it, but computer is able to analyze the images and extract useful information out following specific instructions from the programmer. Due to the nature of computer,  it is able to perform analyzes on a large scale with specific instructions. This paper will discuss how computer vision is used in determining water turbidity through recognizing the secchi disk and extracting measurements as useful information, and how computer vision is applied to a big data set.

Introductions
Secchi disk is an eight inch circular disk has alternating black and white color on the surface. It is used to determine the turbidity or the transparency of the water. The way it works is that secchi disk is lowered into the water slowly using a tape that has measurements, and the researcher would record the measurement when the secchi disk is no longer visible. But one single measurement does not offer many information to be useful, useful information can only be extracted by researchers when there are many more measurements. But it would take researcher enormous amount of time to keep in track with each and every measurement. And computer vision is needed here to replace all that workload.
Instead of having researcher record every measurement, a camera can be placed by the measurement that has visual on both the tape measurement and the secchi disk. The process of lowering secchi disk can be repeated in different locations, and each process will return result in the format of a video. And computer will be able to extract the necessary information from the video and mitigate the workload for the researcher.
